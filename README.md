# triplet_exp
## Experiment 1:
Train deep-nets on xor data (fixed sample size) with kaleab's architectures, take off the penultimate layer, train the penultimate layer for r-xor for varying sample size, see the accuracy, compare it to the accuracy achieved when the whole network was trained on r-xor.
